# Description
*A ticketing website developed for the 2022-2023 class of LTW @FEUP*

Refer to tag [final-delivery-v2](https://github.com/FEUP-LTW-2023/project-ltw13g02/releases/tag/final-delivery-v2), as we had to make some changes post submission so all features we implemented could be properly accessed and tested.

**Technologies used:** HTML, CSS, PHP, sqlite3, Ajax and JavaScript

## Highlighted features
- Right-clicking an inferior clearance user's name anywhere on the website will give you upgrade and downgrade options
- Profile page input fields adapt size when input is added or deleted
- Faq entry page displays paragraphs as they were inserted when creating it
- Agents and admins can belong to multiple departments simultaneously
